## 📅 Day 3 — SQL Journey

- Started learning the 3 SQL command categories:
  - **DDL** — CREATE, ALTER, DROP
  - **DML** — INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - **DQL** — SELECT (used to query data)
- Why SQL?
  - To communicate with data
  - It is in high demand globally
  - Industry standard for analytics
- Installed SQL Server + SSMS
- Explored the interface
- Learned how to import databases using:
  - New Query (script import)
  - Backup restore


# Day 4 – SQL Fundamentals Practice

Today I practiced the essential SQL clauses:

### SELECT
Used to retrieve specific columns or all records from a table.

### FROM
Specifies which table the data should come from.

### WHERE
Used to filter rows based on conditions.

### ORDER BY
Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.

### Notes:
- Practiced queries on multiple sample tables in SQL Server.
- Becoming more comfortable navigating SSMS.
- Reinforced understanding of basic syntax structure.

- ### **Day 5 — SQL Practice Log**

**Topics Practiced:**

* `GROUP BY`
* `HAVING`
* `DISTINCT`
* `TOP`
* Writing multiple queries
* Syntax highlighting understanding

**Commands Covered:**

* **DDL:** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
* **DML:** `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`

**Notes:**
Focusing on writing clean queries and understanding when to use each command. Gaining confidence with data manipulation and structuring datasets for analysis.
Progress is steady.

# Day 6 – SQL Practice

### Covered Today:
- **WHERE Operators**
  - Comparison  
  - Logical  
  - Range  
  - Membership  
  - Search  

- **JOIN Operators**
  - INNER JOIN  
  - LEFT JOIN  
  - RIGHT JOIN  
  - FULL JOIN  

- **SET Operators**
  - UNION  
  - UNION ALL  
  - EXCEPT  
  - INTERSECT  

### Notes:
Practiced filtering data, combining tables, and working with different result sets. SQL logic is becoming more intuitive with hands-on exercises.

## 📅 Day 7 — SQL Joins Practice

Today I focused entirely on SQL JOINs since they are one of the core foundations of relational databases.

### ✔️ What I Practiced:
- INNER JOIN  
- LEFT JOIN  
- RIGHT JOIN  
- FULL OUTER JOIN

## 📅 Day 8 — Advanced SQL Joins

Today I deepened my understanding of **advanced SQL join operations**.  
The focus was on mastering how tables relate to each other in more complex scenarios and how different join types affect query results.

### 🔍 Topics Covered
- Advanced INNER JOIN cases  
- LEFT vs RIGHT JOIN behavior in multi-table relationships  
- FULL OUTER JOIN with conditional filtering  
- Combining join logic with WHERE operators  
- Handling ambiguous column references with table aliases  
- Understanding join performance considerations

### 🎯 Key Takeaways
- JOINs are the backbone of relational databases; mastering them increases speed and accuracy when querying large datasets.
- Table aliases significantly improve readability in multi-table queries.
- Choosing the **right join type** is essential for returning the expected results, especially when dealing with missing or unmatched data.

### 🧠 Moving Forward
Next step: **Set Functions** (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT) and using them with GROUP BY for analytical queries.

## 📅 Day 9 – SQL Practice

Revisited core SQL concepts to reinforce understanding before moving deeper:

- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Comparison operators
- Range & membership filtering
- JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)

Purpose: strengthen fundamentals before starting **SET operators**.
