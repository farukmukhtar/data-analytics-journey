- Why SQL?
  - To communicate with data
  - It is in high demand globally
  - Industry standard for analytics

# Day 4 – SQL Fundamentals Practice

Today I practiced the essential SQL clauses:

### SELECT
Used to retrieve specific columns or all records from a table.

### FROM
Specifies which table the data should come from.

### WHERE
Used to filter rows based on conditions.

### ORDER BY
Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.

### Notes:
- Practiced queries on multiple sample tables in SQL Server.
- Becoming more comfortable navigating SSMS.
- Reinforced understanding of basic syntax structure.

Progress is steady.
